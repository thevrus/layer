# Contributing to Layer

Thanks for your interest! Here's how to contribute:

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly in Chrome
5. Commit (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
6. Push (`git push origin feature/new-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep it minimal - every feature should justify its complexity

## Testing

- Test on Chrome (latest)
- Verify extension loads without errors
- Check that rules persist after browser restart
- Ensure no console errors on injected pages

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Update README.md if adding features
- Keep PRs focused on single features
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link related issues
